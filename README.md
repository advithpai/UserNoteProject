User Note Management Project

A Spring Boot backend project for managing user notes with secure JWT authentication. Users can register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on their personal notes. Notes are automatically linked to the logged-in user using the JWT token.

Key Features:
- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Create, read, update, delete notes
- Secure access to user-specific data
- Spring Boot with Entity-Service-Repository-Controller architecture
- Database integration using JPA

Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Maven, JPA

This project helped me learn about backend development, security, and building real-world REST APIs.
